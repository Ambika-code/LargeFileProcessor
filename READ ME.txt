Large File Processor

Programming language -  Python

Database - MYSQL

Installation:

Installed MySQl Workbench(For Storing db) and Sublime text(For Python code compilation)

Lets Start!

Sample rows

Python Database connectivity is used here.

SQL DB and Python code is connected using mysql connector

Implementation
1. There is a mysql DB server  has the ProductDatabase, having a mysql table ProductTable and the 
ProductAggregation for ProductTable on the Names column is carried out.
2.  Large file processor is used as a docker where Product data file to be ingested.
3.  Create the users, grant permissions, create Product data base ,ProductTable inside it and a ProductAggregation view,
Spin up LargeFileProcessor, which takes the Product csv file as an input and processes it,Prints the state of the ProductTable and 
ProductAggregation.

LargeFileProcessor can have 3 components : Product data registrar,Product Data ingestion manager,Product data aggregator and its manager,Driver 
Driver initializes the DB accessing, Product Registrar, Product Data ingestion manager and Calls.

Steps to run code:

Run Python code while mysql is connected to the server 

Future Improvements:

1. ProductAggregate in mysql view has more data,so we will have to move it to big data or other solutions.
2. Update Product table and  Aggregation table.
3. Handling failures occured during ingestion and aggregation.
